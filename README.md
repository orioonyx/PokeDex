## Features Overview üõ†Ô∏è

- **Clean Architecture**
    - Clear separation of concerns with `app`, `data`, and `domain` modules, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

- **MVVM Design Pattern**
    - Decouples the View and ViewModel for better organization of UI logic and business rules.

- **Offline-First Approach**
    - Data persistence using **Room** for Pok√©mon details and caching.

- **Jetpack Components**
    - **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data lifecycle-aware for efficient state management.
    - **Room**: Provides a robust local database with type-safe queries.
    - **LiveData**: Observes changes in UI-related data seamlessly.
    - **Palette**: Extracts prominent colors from images for dynamic UI design.

- **Data Binding & View Binding**
    - Simplifies UI updates by directly binding UI components to data and reduces boilerplate code for view references.

- **Reactive Programming**
    - Powered by **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow** for handling asynchronous tasks and state management efficiently.

- **Networking**
    - **Retrofit & OkHttp**: Fast and reliable networking stack for API communication.
    - **Moshi**: JSON parsing library integrated with Retrofit for seamless data handling.

- **Dependency Injection**
    - Using **Hilt** for scalable and testable dependency injection.

- **Image Loading**
    - **Glide**: Efficient image loading and caching library for handling Pok√©mon images.

- **Logging**
    - **Timber**: Lightweight and extensible logging library for debugging.

- **Comprehensive Testing**
    - **JUnit**, **Kotest**, **MockK**: For unit testing.
    - **Espresso**: For UI testing.
    - **Hilt Testing**: Simplified dependency injection in tests.
    - **Coroutine Testing**: For verifying suspend functions and flows.
